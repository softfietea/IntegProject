  <v-card-text>The Technological Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P.) is one of the countryâ€™s premier technological, engineering, and computing higher educational institutions.  It is a private non-sectarian stock school founded on February 8, 1962 by a group of educators headed by Engineer Demetrio A. Quirino, Jr. and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino. Using an outcomes-based educational model with its locally and globally accredited programs, T.I.P. allows students to acquire industry-desired qualities and essential experiences that better equip them to be effective as soon as they enter the workforce or set up their own business.</v-card-text>
