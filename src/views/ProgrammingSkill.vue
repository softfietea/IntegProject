      text="I was able to learn flutter mobile app development when my team/classmates created sylviapp as our capstone project last year. The complexity of learning this framework is not that hard because it has a wonderful and concise documentation that the developers can reference to during the development phases. It could be a framework that can be popular next following year."

      text="I was able to learn react native just tip of its basic fundamentals and core concept, with the expo help I can able to make a basic application with guide from its documentation. What I noticed is that the documentation of react native is more difficult to understand unlike flutter but the concept of developing the app is easy to understand and the syntax of it is very familiar since the javascript language is very popular from the web developers. React native is good to learn while learning flutter, because you can relate what are the differences and similarities when it comes to the development process."

      text="I learned Vue because of this course and Laravel also from the past courses, These two are the things that I can offer when it comes to developing website. I'm not into the web development but learning these two enhance my ability to understand more clearly some state management, API, things that can be used in mobile development as well in the web development processes. I find it hard to learn frameworks in the side of web development but having this kind of skill is required if you want to enhance your logical thinking."
